# MOD95 Player

The **MOD95 Player** is a historical piece of software that allows you to play module music (MOD files) on Windows. It was written by Olivier Lapicque in the mid-90s and served as the precursor to MODPlug Player, MODPlugin, ModPlug Tracker, and eventually OpenMPT.

I cleaned it up and put it on GitHub for preservation. This will compile with Visual Studio Community 2022 as a 64-bit application.
